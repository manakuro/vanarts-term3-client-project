	(1, '15 Times Adele Was Truly Hilarious', '<p>Adele shocked everyone when she took part in James Corden\'s Carpool Karaoke series. Her funny, word-perfect rendition of Nicki Minaj\'s guest verse from Kanye West\'s huge collab track \'Monster\' took the internet by storm and showed the keen sense of humour lacking in her knitted-by-nana music – but it\'s not the first time Adele\'s shown us her comedy chops. Here\'s 15 of her funniest moments.</p>\n\n<h3>1. When she high-fived Daniel Craig</h3>\n\n\n<p>This was at the Golden Globes 2013, when Adele\'s theme tune for \'Skyfall\' – also called \'Skyfall\', of course – nabbed the award for Best Original Song from under Taylor Swift\'s nose. Adele, who was sitting two places away from Bond actor Daniel Craig, took the opportunity to give him a cheeky high-five. Later, when she accepts the award, she tells the huge crowd of big-name actors that she and her friend Ida, both new mums, had just come for a night out. "We\'ve been pissing ourselves laughing at all of you." \n<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/M5xlM88kVLE?start=120" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>\n</p>\n\n<h3>2. When she mistook the man who signed her for a pervert</h3>\n\n<p>When she was trying to get signed, Adele got a series of emails from a man at a record label, and assumed they were from a pervert. It wasn\'t until she read them properly that she realised he was trying to give her a record deal.\n<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TVk_B3uJT68" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>\n</p>\n\n\n<h3>3.When she went mad with power over Graham Norton’s chair</h3>\n\n<p>\nPut Adele on a red sofa with a glass of wine and a handle, and she will pull that handle. All this guy had said was that he had been in Germany, and she chucked him off.\n<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Wfr2MHYgHpw" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>\n<p>\n\n<h3>4. When she made this face after performing on SNL</h3>\n\n<p>"With my stage fright," Adele has said, "I just don\'t want to let people down. I get so nervous on stage that I don\'t have the guts to improvise or anything like that." After her performance on SNL late last year, she made this face to express her relief. \n<iframe src="https://vine.co/v/izWvTuddb60/embed/simple" width="100%" height="600" frameborder="0" class=" pinged loaded in-view"></iframe>\n</p>\n\n<h3>5. When she pranked her own impersonators</h3>\n\n<p>Schmaltzy though it may be, this clip is also pretty funny. In it, Adele dons a prosthetic nose and takes part in an Adele-impersonating competition to prank her tribute acts. The best bits are her thoughts.\n<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/OHXjxWaQs9o" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>\n</p>\n\n<h3>6. When she told this story about flashing a bus stop full of people</h3>\n\n<p>It involves her going out early in the morning wearing a poncho and no pants. It was windy.\n<iframe width="100%" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/C50OmfetUBA" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen=""></iframe>\n</p>\n', 'img/news/news_1.jpg', 'img/news/news_1.jpg', '2017-04-03 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', 0),

	(1, 'Chance The Rapper - \'Coloring Book\' Review', '<p>On the cusp of becoming a household name, Chance The Rapper has glided towards stardom almost exclusively from an online buzz that’s just begun gaining real world traction. Going against the grain naturally, his nearly mystic rise hasn’t relied on typical career boosting crutches: Chance’s songs have generally been devoid of Auto-Tune and absent from radio rotation or nightclubs, he’s never inspired a trendy dance craze, yet he’s amassed a loyal following determined to see these differences bear fruit. Arguably the face of Chicago Hip Hop’s present momentum, his impact has given voice to a conflicted generation whose psyche is at war; adolescents and young adults influenced by Kanye West’s ingenious innovation with a bleak firsthand view of the low life expectancy Chief Keef popularized.</p>\n\n<p>Since starting to rap professionally while fresh out of puberty, Chance The Rapper has become an open book unafraid to deal with his growing pains publicly. A most humble and charitable figure for the Windy City, if comparisons to Kendrick Lamar aren’t inevitable, they’re readily abundant. Two sides of the same coin using their voices in tandem with live instrumentation, the rageful angst from Compton’s "good kid" is the yin to the yang of Chance’s lighter and more subdued panic. Another commonality arises as they’ve both pushed the envelope creatively to explain the pressures of their gang-ridden environments without begging for acceptance from greater society. On a more rebellious note, the pair have managed to fit in while wedging personal responsibility in a youth driven culture that leans towards shirking progression.</p>\n\n<p>Making thematic cover art for each release, 10 Day represented Chance The Rapper’s cautious and hopeful beginnings, Acid Rap could be interpreted as fear in the face of the storm, and Coloring Book is a clever smile of contentment. Foreshadowed by The Life Of Pablo’s “Ultralight Beam,” the bulk of the project celebrates his faith and how far it’s quickly brought him up the rap game’s ladder. Early previews came by way of “Blessings” premiering on Jimmy Fallon’s stage recently and “Angels” being done on Stephen Colbert’s show last year. The two unabashedly Christian songs respectively explain his grassroots approach of giving away music, as he says “I don’t make songs for free, I make ‘em for freedom” and “I’m still at my old church, only ever sold merch.” Album opener "All We Got" is a triumphant praise session where Chance modestly flexes his good fortune including being a new father. With the aid of frequent bandmate Donnie Trumpet, he employs a Sunday morning preacher’s style of building up to an explosive outburst, as Kanye and the Chicago Children’s Choir bring things full circle from the protégé’s greatest exposure to date just three months ago.</p>\n\n<p>Acid Rap was Chance The Rapper’s instantaneous breakthrough with features including Ab-Soul, Childish Gambino and Action Bronson, rising peers who were in sync with his left-field niche. Coloring Book attempts reinventing the wheel not only with a heavier emphasis on God, but our protagonist taking noticeable risks walking amongst Hip Hop’s supposed sinners much like Jesus did. Upon a first listen, “No Problem” is off-putting given Chance’s awkward flow most reminiscent of Young Thug’s widely debated spontaneity (not to mention a flashy appearance by 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne’s standard codeine-addled lack of substance). The song grows to be catchy upon multiple spins, but this effect isn’t replicated as linguistic acrobat Young Thugger himself and quirky newcomer Lil Yachty contribute little worth to “Mixtape,” one of Coloring Book’s dullest moments. A surprising highlight comes by way of trap rhythm meeting heavenly melodies on the smooth yet rousing “Smoke Break”, where Future’s performance sounds almost palatable as opposed to his well renowned erratic means of turning up. This curveball is indicative of Chance’s capacity to shape the culture at his will, whether he plays these reindeer games to bridge gaps for the genre or simply capitalize on his growing fame.</p>\n\n<p>Refusing to be boxed into preconceived notions, Chance The Rapper is not only adjusting the paradigm for independent business, his presence has the potential to save the minds and lives of endangered Chicagoans. A sequel of sorts to last year’s less memorable compilation Surf (namely its single "Sunday Candy"), Coloring Book further reflects his liberty to create as he pleases. “Finish Line/Drown” admits to a prior harmful Xanax addiction as Chance sprints towards salvation. After this confessional the two-parter transitions from Hip Hop completely into gospel, as devout holy roller Kirk Franklin takes the baton from him to pray on wax together for a second time in 2016.</p>\n\n<p>As a mix of the secular and spiritual worlds, Coloring Book is sure to perplex Chance The Rapper’s fickle fans and satisfy the more adventurous open to being thrown for a loop. Rather than cheap ploys to cross over, the questionable collaborations are more likely calculated concessions with the intent of sneaking his evangelical message to a greater audience. After the communion cup runs empty, Chance proves himself worthy of hero worship by subtly and subversively overthrowing the commercialized horrors of his town’s violent drill movement.</p>', 'img/reviews/reviews_1.jpg', 'img/reviews/thumb/reviews_thumb_1.jpg', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-05-01 00:00:00', '2016-05-01 00:00:00', 0),
	(2, 'Jarvis Cocker - \'EP\' Review', '<p>When Jarvis Cocker recorded a tribute to the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks and broadcast it on his Radio 6 Music show – Jarvis Cocker’s Sunday Service – last November, listeners dared to dream he might record new music again. Aside from some deeply experimental cuts for his 20 Golden Greats exhibition, the Pulp frontman hasn’t brought out any new music since his 2009 solo album ‘Further Complications’, suggesting he’d all but retired from recording. Well, fear not, because Jarvis has returned and he’s back to his lascivious, brazen best on this four-track EP, written to accompany the upcoming TV series Likely Stories.</p>\n\n<p>Based on four short stories by author Neil Gaiman and directed by Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard (who oversaw the Nick Cave mockumentary 20,000 Days On Earth), the series consists of, in Cocker’s own words, “four grubby tales set in all-night cafés, low-rent drinking dens and doctor’s surgeries”.</p>\n\n<p>Cocker’s passion for Paris (where he used to live) is evident, with ‘Main Theme’ undoubtedly influenced by his hero, scandalous French singer Serge Gainsbourg. We’ve been here before of course, on all of Pulp’s 1998 album ‘This Is Hardcore’ and bits of 1995’s ‘Different Class’, but never quite to this degree of salacity. The roll call of musicians includes Portishead’s Adrian Utley on synths and Scott Walker’s percussionist Alasdair Malloy, but it’s Jarvis’s inimitable spoken word that really gets the hairs on the back of your neck standing to attention.</p>\n\n<p>“Roundheads and cavaliers,” he quivers, “adult themes and childhood fears”. Our avuncular protagonist goes on to list a baby in a jar, an old man in a car and a cow jumping over the moon – and if things weren’t surreal enough, he’s then joined by a celestial choir. It’s a cinematic and slightly troubling creation perfect for a series of small-screen psychological thrillers, but ‘Main Theme’ stands up on its own as a composition too. The remaining tracks are scaled-down variations on the same musical theme, including the creepy ‘Looking For The Girl’, and ‘Foraging’, where he recites a list of edible fungi found in Britain.</p>\n\n<p>It’s been a while, but if this taster is anything to go by, you can hopefully prepare yourselves for some more vintage Jarvis in the not-too-distant future.</p>', 'img/reviews/reviews_2.jpg', 'img/reviews/thumb/reviews_thumb_2.jpg', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', 0),
	(3, 'Radiohead - \'A Moon Shaped Pool\' Review', '<p>Radiohead, who titled their ninth studio album A Moon Shaped Pool, have a unique grasp on how easily profundity can slip into banality. Their music is obsessed with the point where great truths harden into platitudes, where pure signal meets wretched noise. In the past, Thom Yorke has sharply peppered his lyrics with everyday cliches to suggest a mind consumed by meaningless data, but on the new album, he largely moves beyond cynicism. He is now considering simpler truths in a heretofore-unexplored register: wonder and amazement. “This goes beyond me, beyond you,” he sings on “Daydreaming.” “We are just happy to serve you.” There is no concealed razor under Yorke’s tongue as he offers this thought, or in the pearly music that surrounds him. It sounds for all the world like the most cloistered and isolated soul in modern rock music opening up and admitting a helplessness far more personal than he’s ever dared. Yorke has flirted with surrender before, and on A Moon Shaped Pool, that submission feels nearly complete.</p>\n\n<p>The album is framed by two older pieces of music that act as gateways to the darker, unfamiliar waters within. Opener “Burn the Witch” has been floating around, in some form or another, since Kid A. “This is a low-flying panic attack,” Yorke announces, explicitly linking to the bad old days of air crashes, iron lungs, and wolves at doors. (In fact, several of the song’s lyrics—“avoid all eye contact,” “cheer at the gallows”—first appeared in the album art to 2003’s anti-Bush polemic Hail to the Thief.) Meanwhile, Jonny Greenwood’s brittle modernist string arrangement reinforces the angst, turning the orchestra into a giant pair of gnashing teeth. It’s a vintage splash of Radiohead stomach acid, a cloud of gnats unleashed in your cranial nerves.</p>\n\n<p>It also feels like an exorcism for what follows: a plunge into something scarier than the military industrial complex, or the insidious nature of propaganda, or human nature’s disturbing tendency towards unquestioning obedience. Yorke separated from his partner of 23 years and the mother to his two children last August, and on “Identikit,” he sings “Broken hearts make it rain” and “When I see you messin’ me around, I don’t want to know.”</p>\n\n<p>That isn’t to say that this is necessarily a “break-up album.” Separations (particularly those involving children) take place in the harsh light of day, with lawyers’ appointments and checklists and logistical arrangements. Radiohead albums are the stuff of dreams and nightmares, and the band retains a healthy resistance to clarity; their music is a maze of signs you can peer into any way you like. Even so, the impact of trauma, a sort of car crash of the soul, is palpable. The music here feels loose and unknotted, broken open in the way you can only be after a tragedy. “There’s a spacecraft blocking out the sky,” Yorke observes on “Decks Dark,” as choral voices pass overhead. The scene is straight from 1997’s “Subterranean Homesick Alien,” but here Yorke doesn’t sound “uptight.” He sounds utterly drained, as if impending invasion doesn’t concern him at all.</p>\n\n<p>A song title like “Glass Eyes” hints at many of the band’s longstanding morbid preoccupations—the semblance of humanity in something cold and dead, or the violation of the biological body by foreign objects—but the song is a bloodflow of strings straight into the heart. “Hey it’s me, I just got off the train,” Yorke sings, and it’s a strikingly ordinary image: the Paranoid Android himself, picking up the phone and calling someone to tell them he’s just arrived. “I feel this love turn cold,” he confesses as the ballad draws to a close, the phrasing an echo, subconscious or not, of his Kid A sign-off “I’ll see you in the next life.” A throbbing cello appears like a lump in the throat; the song fades away.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the album, Yorke’s everyday enlightenment is backed by music of expanse and abandon. The guitars sound like pianos, the pianos sound like guitars, and the mixes breathe with pastoral calm. “The Numbers,” a song about the impending apocalypse brought on by climate change, meanders along, its groove as wide as an ocean. Even the malevolent synth wave that passes through “Ful Stop” sounds like a visitor, a momentary darkness rather than a caged spirit. As the song builds, the band works up a coursing groove that will feel familiar to longtime fans, with its interlocking guitars and an arterial bustle of rhythms serving to launch Yorke’s wordless moan. It’s a sound that Radiohead has spent the last decade honing, but the payoff here is deeper and more gratifying than it has been in a while.</p>\n\n<p>The added dimension comes from Yorke, who pumps fresh oxygen into these songs, many of which have existed in sketch-like forms for years. On the lonely folk hymn “Desert Island Disk,” he sings of an epiphanic experience: “The wind rushing ‘round my open heart/An open ravine/In my spirit white.” As a vision of transformation, it feels like the inverse to Amnesiac’s “Pyramid Song,” where his only companions were the dead; here, he is “totally alive.”</p>\n\n<p>And then there’s “True Love Waits.” It’s an old song, one that has been around in various forms for over two decades, but unlike “Burn the Witch” or the other teased sketches and scraps that Radiohead diehards pick apart on forums, it’s long been a part of their canon. It appeared on the 2001 live album I Might Be Wrong and, dragged into 2016, feels like a relic from a different geological era. “I’ll drown my beliefs,” Yorke sings, “just don’t leave.” It is the message they leave us with, this very open-hearted song that has always felt like an open wound in their discography, a geyser of feeling erupting out of scorched earth. Its very inclusion is a striking moment of transparency.</p>\n\n<p>The version here is just Yorke and a piano, so reverberant and echo-drenched that it feels like we’ve stuck our heads inside it. Yorke croons tenderly, never opening up into his chest voice. It’s sung to one person this time, not crowds. In its mundane visions of “lollipops and crisps,” the lyrics purposefully skirt doggerel, an acknowledgment that cliches can be, in fact, where all the action is. “I’m not living/I’m just killing time,” the 47-year-old admits. You can write a line like that and set it to music; you can perform it for years in front of adoring millions; you can carry the idea around in your heart and mind. But it might take a lifetime for it to strike, as it does here, with a newfound power. The truth, as always, lies in plain sight, right there in the kicking and the squealing, the panic and the vomit. Some truths just take longer to see than others.</p>', 'img/reviews/reviews_3.jpg', 'img/reviews/thumb/reviews_thumb_3.jpg', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', 0),
	(4, 'Skepta - \'Konnichiwa\' Review', '<p>There are probably many reasons why grime, after a brief and thrilling heyday followed by a lapse into awkward pop crossover and Robbie Williams guestspots, is back in a big way. Most of them, though, point back to Skepta. Tottenham’s Joseph Adengua had a crack at the charts like all the rest, donning a white suit and skanking about with girls in bikinis on the video to 2008’s ‘Rolex Sweep’. But it was Skepta, more than anyone, who saw the potential in a return to grime’s first principles. His 2014 single ‘That’s Not Me’, made with his brother Jme, and promoted with an £80 video, set out the formula: hard rhymes, street fashion, alpha male attitude. He wasn’t the only MC out there grafting – but by example, he proved what was still possible.</p>\n\n<p>‘Konnichiwa’ has been promised pretty much since ‘That’s Not Me’ hit the charts, the sort of timespan that usually sets expectations unreasonably high. Incredibly, it meets them on all counts. Skepta is on scorching form throughout, his direct, firmly enunciated bars addressing rival MCs (‘Lyrics’, featuring grime upstart Novelist), life in the fast lane (‘Detox’, featuring Boy Better Know compadres Frisco, Shorty and Jammer) and hassle from the feds – see ‘Crime Riddim’, a menacing UK trap anthem on which Skepta faces the prospect of a strip-search with typical forthrightness: “Fuck that, I ain’t a Chippendale”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are familiar themes – but brilliantly, ‘Konnichiwa’ is packed with surprises. It’s quintessentially British, a grime album to the core – but big and confident enough to feature a guest production and vocal from Pharrell Williams (see the bouncy ‘Numbers’, a witty two fingers to music industry sharks), or casually sample Queens Of The Stone Age on the broiling ‘Man (Gang)’. </p>\n\n<p>Best of all, it’s practically filler-free. Most grime albums get unstuck when they get sentimental, or approach the boudoir. But ‘Ladies Hit Squad’, featuring a purring D Double E and A$AP Nast, proves grime can get jiggy, while ‘Text Me Back’ is a love letter, Skepta pleading with his girl to stay patient while he’s out there doing his thing. She’d better get herself a good hobby: ‘Konnichiwa’ is a landmark in British street music, a record good enough to take on the world without having to compromise one inch in the process.</p>\n', 'img/reviews/reviews_4.jpg', 'img/reviews/thumb/reviews_thumb_4.jpg', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', 0),
	(5, 'Drake - \'Views\' Review', '<p>“Know thyself.” — Socrates</p>\n\n<p>“There are three things extremely hard: steel, a diamond, and to know one’s self.” — Benjamin Franklin</p>\n\n<p>“I’ve always been me, I guess I know myself.” — Drake</p>\n\n<p>Know yourself, the theory goes, and you will know all. The world will open up to you. Existence will be made plain. You will be one with the matrix. Yadda yadda yadda. From arenas to memes, Drake has always had a skill for turning his innermost thoughts, feelings, and anxieties into breakthrough group therapy sessions—he articulates what we know to be true and then lets us rap or sing those truths en masse, exalting in common bonds that are as vulnerable as they are revealing. When he confides his fears, we become a little more fearless. When he turns his woes into anthems, we all get lifted. But there is a razor-sharp line between self-awareness and self-absorption: Whereas self-awareness can expand wisdom by reflecting it outward, self-absorption often festers, drawing things in only to let them rot. For the past seven years, Drake has expertly glided along that line. But on his fourth proper album, he edges closer than ever to a mirrored abyss, a suffocating echo chamber of self.</p>\n\n<p>The record is called VIEWS but its perspective is decidedly singular. “This album, I’m very proud to say, is just—I feel like I told everybody how I’m actually feeling,” Drake told Zane Lowe in a toothless recent interview, differentiating VIEWS from his previous work. This might seem like a ridiculous distinction—there’s never any question that Drake is the star of his own show—but it’s apt, and it hints at why this album feels like more of a claustrophobic mindfuck than a collective catharsis. VIEWS is what happens when venting turns into whining. Spanning an obnoxious 82 minutes, the record goes through several musical and thematic phases, but the overall atmosphere is bitter, petty, worn-down. It confuses loyalty and stagnation, wallowing in a sound that is starting to show its limits.</p>\n\n<p>Until the last minute, the album was to be called Views from the 6, and it still serves as an ode to Drake’s hometown of Toronto. After having other producers handle the lion’s share of beats on his last two mixtapes, Drake\'s longtime musical consigliere, Noah “40” Shebib, returns to the head of the table here, with production credits on 12 of the album’s 20 tracks. The atmosphere 40 creates with his music is now synonymous with Drake’s Toronto; the harsh chill of winter is brought forth via cold snares and ice-cube synths, with the summer’s relief often rendered through sped-up ‘90s R&B samples that quietly churn in the background. It’s essentially a screwed-down take on Kanye West’s chipmunk soul, and it has provided a perfect backdrop for Drake’s poignant introspection while ushering in an entire stage of hip-hop’s evolution.</p>\n\n<p>But on VIEWS, the style is simply getting tired, its wintry mood now actively blocking any springtime salvation. It’s also bringing out some of Drake’s most self-loathing tendencies, playing into his groaning paranoia on tracks like “9,” where he laments, “Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it/Doesn’t matter where I go, I can never get away from it.” Songs like these play out like dour self-fulfilling prophecies, puffed-up bad attitudes drunk on their own misery. They also expose the downside of a “no new friends” mindset and how a bunker mentality can snub out curiosity. Marked by frigidness and a furrowed brow, much of VIEWS may be true to Toronto’s darker months, but it also makes the city sound like a pretty inhospitable place.</p>\n\n<p>Fact is, the 6 is one of the most multicultural places on Earth, a sprawling metropolis in which more than 140 different languages and dialects are spoken. And it’s when VIEWS embraces this more inviting and open-minded side of Toronto that it points to a better way forward. Drake’s fascination with the city’s Caribbean enclaves take root in the effervescent rhythms of songs like “With You,” “One Dance,” and “Too Good”—all of them featuring welcomed guest vocals that break up the monotony and also allow Drake to get out of his own brain for a second.</p>\n\n<p>Rihanna co-stars on “Too Good,” finally offering a counterpoint to Drake’s constant disappointment with the opposite sex; when she sings “You take my love for granted, I just don’t understand it,” she’s giving voice to all of the women Drake has spurned on record over the years. (Perhaps tellingly, she only gets to sing the line alongside her duet partner.) Because while Drake’s relationship dissections were once questioning and openly hurt, they too have hardened—at this point, it’s getting impossible to believe he’s not the one to blame for so many squandered attempts at love.</p>\n\n<p>Even slight tweaks to Drake’s usual sound pay dividends here. “Childs Play” finds 40 putting his spin on New Orleans bounce, bringing out Drake’s more playful side as he raps about a lady friend who gets in a fight with him at The Cheesecake Factory and takes his Bugatti for a spin to pick up some tampons. The song’s angst plays out more like a jokey spat than another existential treatise on the hopelessness of searching for the girl of his dreams. “Feel No Ways” is another sad story, but its beat—which zips up Malcolm McClaren’s 1983 hip-hop experiment “World’s Famous”—harkens back to Drake’s masterpiece, Take Care, adding levity and the sense that these feelings, like all feelings, will not be so heavy in time. “Weston Road Flows” is another throwback, with Drake reminiscing about his salad days over a gorgeous Mary J. Blige sample, another instance of a woman’s voice helping to add humanity to the rapper’s toughened exterior. The song finds Drake looking back on his come-up with fondness and, naturally, some melancholy. But when he lets out a little cackle at the end of the track, it’s not out of spite. He sounds like he’s genuinely enjoying himself on the song. It’s nice to hear.</p>\n\n<p>If last year’s If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late had Drake doing his best all-guns-blazing Tony Montana, shedding his softness for an untouchable-don pose, VIEWS has him on his Tony Soprano, trying to reach deep into his own psyche for revelations but often just falling back on a sour version of what got him this far. Perhaps its shortcomings are in part due to a cloistered view of what being candid really means. “I’m an honest person, I can’t write fiction,” Drake said last week. “It all directly has to do with me or else I can’t make the music.” While artistic honesty is certainly something to aspire to, it doesn’t have to equate with blinding selfishness or even concrete reality. Drake’s most apparent current rap peers, Kanye and Kendrick Lamar, have both let their minds wander to surreal places in order to add depth and intrigue to their own music, and nobody would accuse them of dishonesty. Such inventiveness is required for the type of longevity Drake seems to crave. Because knowing thyself is a quest. It never ends.</p>', 'img/reviews/reviews_5.jpg', 'img/reviews/thumb/reviews_thumb_5.jpg', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', 0),

	(7, 'N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton is a true summer blockbuster', '<p>Straight Outta Compton, a forthcoming biopic about the formative L.A. rap group N.W.A., is layered with the message of self-preservation — and is becoming increasingly more timely within pop culture the closer it gets to its US release date on August 14.</p>\n\n<p>Comprised of Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, MC Ren and DJ Yella, the “reality rap” technicians — the term was theirs; it was often called “gangster rap” by the media, which, historically, stuck — built a new tentpole in the genre, highlighting the truths of their own lives through narratives about guns, drugs and unwarranted police brutality.</p>\n\n<p>The film, helmed by legendary music video director F. Gary Gray (also responsible for Friday, among many others), recounts a loose version of their origin story, from Dr. Dre and Ice Cube’s garage collaborations to the nightclubs where they first started, and how, with Eazy’s drug money and the popularity of his first single ‘Boyz N The Hood,’ he was able to co-found his label Ruthless Records with manager Jerry Heller, who had previously worked with artists like Styx, Black Sabbath and Crosby, Stills and Nash. For rap historians and West Coast hip-hop aficionados, the lore of N.W.A. is well-known, from the rise to prominence of their controversial, FBI-defamed ‘Fuck tha Police’ to the founding of Death Row Records with Suge Knight to Dr. Dre’s liberation movement with his own Aftermath label.</p>\n\n<p>Even with that much information packed air-tight into two and a half hours, Compton is not perfect. Much of the narrative is tweaked for entertainment purposes and brutal stories like Dr. Dre’s misogyny-fueled assault of music journalist Dee Barnes have been omitted from script. One could argue that the preservation of N.W.A.’s legacy and creating a portal for younger rap fans to see into some of this crucial history of the genre is important — and this wouldn’t be wrong, but an awareness that this is a friendlier, so to speak, version of their story is important, too.</p>\n\n<p>But aside from just crystallizing N.W.A.’s place in music history, there are story arcs within Compton that mirror life today, despite taking place well over two decades ago. Early into the film, Cube is confronted by the police for simply walking out of Dr. Dre’s house. In a year that is robust with music biopics (Love & Mercy) and documentaries (Amy, Montage of Heck), Compton, as well as the Nina Simone doc What Happened, Miss Simone?, both have a strong focus on America’s systemic racism and police brutality epidemic. N.W.A. being forcefully interrogated by the LAPD outside of their suburban recording studio was not, and still is not, an anomaly. Despite being used as a storytelling device to the lead to the creation of ‘Fuck Tha Police’, this is a persistent reality in America. And it’s not just acted scenes of police violence. The film also includes real-life footage of the Rodney King beating and L.A. riots of 1993. Like Miss Simone’s catalogue of the March on Selma, this is a portrait of America that is still reflective of the 2010s, despite taking place decades earlier. These scenes are critical to N.W.A.’s history, but their refusal to use art as escapism, instead turning it into political critique, is only a part of their self-preservation.</p>\n\n<p>Ice Cube, who produced the film and is played by his own son O’Shea Jackson Jr., arguably had the tightest grasp of this concept. His lyrics, even as a high schooler coming up in the rap-averse nightclubs where Dre DJed, were escapist spun-yarns about women and cars and about the racial profiling he experienced throughout his life. The creation of ‘Fuck Tha Police’ is portrayed in a condensed fashion — the lyrics crafted almost immediately after the group is abused by cops outside of the swanky suburban studio where their debut album was being recorded — but it’s the still-relevant content that acts as a capsule of his experience of being young and black. Cube was unafraid to shirk money from Ruthless and leave the group in favor of fair representation, even if he was taking on the lion’s share of the lyrical work.</p>\n\n<p>08Suge2-articleLarge</p>\n\n<p>‘NO VASELINE’ IS A REMINDER THAT THESE THINGS ARE MUCH MORE ARTISTICALLY SERIOUS THAN A SLIDESHOW OF TWITTER-MINED MEMES.”</p>\n<p>The film will land while we’re still in the midst, or at least in the dwindling down, of Drake and Meek Mill’s rap beef. If Meek’s supposed initial issue with Drake was that he submitted a ghostwritten verse for Meek’s ‘R.I.C.O.’, watching Ice Cube pen verses for groups Dre was trying to manufacture before passing them along to Eazy-E could, perhaps, nullify Meek’s argument. However, the beef that resulted from Cube’s split from N.W.A. will also shine a light on how these entanglements required a lot more fury than mere “no woman has ever had me starstruck” barbs. The making of Cube’s N.W.A. diss ‘No Vaseline’ is one of the film’s most exhilarating moments. It’s not just the pacing from when Cube hears the group call him Benedict Arnold to them hearing ‘Vaseline’ for the first time — when Jackson, Jr. spits, “Goddamn, I’m glad ya’ll set it off,” it’s a reminder that these things are much more artistically serious than a slideshow of Twitter-mined memes. And Jackson Jr.’s performance in this scene perfectly embodies his father’s spark.</p>\n\n<p>The acting is another one of Compton’s bright spots. Music biopics always have some kind of awkward element to them. Notorious was crammed with misfired casting and some mediocre portrayals of the players, save Naturi Naughton’s brilliant Lil’ Kim. It is slightly jarring to watch Paul Giamatti play Jerry Heller amongst a group of unknown kids, but their performances stack up to his Oscar-nominated caliber of acting. Particularly impressive is New Orleans actor Jason Mitchell, who took on the daunting task of playing Eazy-E, but fully personified his slick, but ultimately, tragic reality.</p>\n\n<p>E himself was on the other side of the self-preservation coin. If Cube’s consistent eye-on-the-prize was the peak, from abandoning being underpaid by Ruthless to finding other avenues to create, then Eazy-E was certain he would live forever, unscathed. Mitchell portrays E as an audacious businessman consumed by money, women and fame. While these are the real stories of two interconnected men’s lives, they respectively manifest what happens if you do or do not take care of yourself.</p>\n\n<p>(This is not to leave out Dr. Dre, who is the most successful surviving member of N.W.A. and whose perseverance and triumphs are reported to us almost daily. The film portrays his alliance with Suge Knight to form Death Row Records and Dre’s business wit to get out of that messy, to put it lightly, deal when he needed more control. He was and is similarly-minded to Ice Cube, but is shown as much more low-key. And, yes, there are appearances from Snoop Dogg and 2Pac.)</p>\n\n<p>With all of its aforementioned faults, as well as some way too on-the-nose dialogue and chronologically misplaced music, Straight Outta Compton is a true summer blockbuster. It is knee-slappingly funny, tugs at your heartstrings and the acting is meticulous. Despite its length, it moves quickly and keeps the viewer consistently engaged, but it’s not to be viewed for pure historical accuracy. (And, no doubt, there will be people who believe the entire thing to be constructed by Hollywood; these are the same people who were shocked when Ian Curtis hanged himself at the end of Control.) But it’s clear that the screenwriters, Ice Cube and Gray were intent to preserve N.W.A.’s legacy in the most favorable way possible. It’s another benchmark in Cube’s career-long history of self-preservation.</p>', 'img/reviews/reviews_7.jpg', 'img/reviews/thumb/reviews_thumb_7.jpg', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', 0),

Rather than framing each physical piece as a vessel of artistic importance, with its initial limited release he displays them in a light of cumbersome inconvenience. The VHS tape features a vintage piece of Jackson’s video art, so there are exceptions to the rule here, but framing this collection of songs under the umbrella of an album (or an attempt to deconstruct one) arguably does more harm to the project than good.

	(9, 'Jarvis Cocker - \'EP\' Review', '<p>When Jarvis Cocker recorded a tribute to the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks and broadcast it on his Radio 6 Music show – Jarvis Cocker’s Sunday Service – last November, listeners dared to dream he might record new music again. Aside from some deeply experimental cuts for his 20 Golden Greats exhibition, the Pulp frontman hasn’t brought out any new music since his 2009 solo album ‘Further Complications’, suggesting he’d all but retired from recording. Well, fear not, because Jarvis has returned and he’s back to his lascivious, brazen best on this four-track EP, written to accompany the upcoming TV series Likely Stories.</p>\n\n<p>Based on four short stories by author Neil Gaiman and directed by Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard (who oversaw the Nick Cave mockumentary 20,000 Days On Earth), the series consists of, in Cocker’s own words, “four grubby tales set in all-night cafés, low-rent drinking dens and doctor’s surgeries”.</p>\n\n<p>Cocker’s passion for Paris (where he used to live) is evident, with ‘Main Theme’ undoubtedly influenced by his hero, scandalous French singer Serge Gainsbourg. We’ve been here before of course, on all of Pulp’s 1998 album ‘This Is Hardcore’ and bits of 1995’s ‘Different Class’, but never quite to this degree of salacity. The roll call of musicians includes Portishead’s Adrian Utley on synths and Scott Walker’s percussionist Alasdair Malloy, but it’s Jarvis’s inimitable spoken word that really gets the hairs on the back of your neck standing to attention.</p>\n\n<p>“Roundheads and cavaliers,” he quivers, “adult themes and childhood fears”. Our avuncular protagonist goes on to list a baby in a jar, an old man in a car and a cow jumping over the moon – and if things weren’t surreal enough, he’s then joined by a celestial choir. It’s a cinematic and slightly troubling creation perfect for a series of small-screen psychological thrillers, but ‘Main Theme’ stands up on its own as a composition too. The remaining tracks are scaled-down variations on the same musical theme, including the creepy ‘Looking For The Girl’, and ‘Foraging’, where he recites a list of edible fungi found in Britain.</p>\n\n<p>It’s been a while, but if this taster is anything to go by, you can hopefully prepare yourselves for some more vintage Jarvis in the not-too-distant future.</p>', 'img/reviews/reviews_2.jpg', 'img/reviews/thumb/reviews_thumb_2.jpg', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', 0),
	(10, 'Radiohead - \'A Moon Shaped Pool\' Review', '<p>Radiohead, who titled their ninth studio album A Moon Shaped Pool, have a unique grasp on how easily profundity can slip into banality. Their music is obsessed with the point where great truths harden into platitudes, where pure signal meets wretched noise. In the past, Thom Yorke has sharply peppered his lyrics with everyday cliches to suggest a mind consumed by meaningless data, but on the new album, he largely moves beyond cynicism. He is now considering simpler truths in a heretofore-unexplored register: wonder and amazement. “This goes beyond me, beyond you,” he sings on “Daydreaming.” “We are just happy to serve you.” There is no concealed razor under Yorke’s tongue as he offers this thought, or in the pearly music that surrounds him. It sounds for all the world like the most cloistered and isolated soul in modern rock music opening up and admitting a helplessness far more personal than he’s ever dared. Yorke has flirted with surrender before, and on A Moon Shaped Pool, that submission feels nearly complete.</p>\n\n<p>The album is framed by two older pieces of music that act as gateways to the darker, unfamiliar waters within. Opener “Burn the Witch” has been floating around, in some form or another, since Kid A. “This is a low-flying panic attack,” Yorke announces, explicitly linking to the bad old days of air crashes, iron lungs, and wolves at doors. (In fact, several of the song’s lyrics—“avoid all eye contact,” “cheer at the gallows”—first appeared in the album art to 2003’s anti-Bush polemic Hail to the Thief.) Meanwhile, Jonny Greenwood’s brittle modernist string arrangement reinforces the angst, turning the orchestra into a giant pair of gnashing teeth. It’s a vintage splash of Radiohead stomach acid, a cloud of gnats unleashed in your cranial nerves.</p>\n\n<p>It also feels like an exorcism for what follows: a plunge into something scarier than the military industrial complex, or the insidious nature of propaganda, or human nature’s disturbing tendency towards unquestioning obedience. Yorke separated from his partner of 23 years and the mother to his two children last August, and on “Identikit,” he sings “Broken hearts make it rain” and “When I see you messin’ me around, I don’t want to know.”</p>\n\n<p>That isn’t to say that this is necessarily a “break-up album.” Separations (particularly those involving children) take place in the harsh light of day, with lawyers’ appointments and checklists and logistical arrangements. Radiohead albums are the stuff of dreams and nightmares, and the band retains a healthy resistance to clarity; their music is a maze of signs you can peer into any way you like. Even so, the impact of trauma, a sort of car crash of the soul, is palpable. The music here feels loose and unknotted, broken open in the way you can only be after a tragedy. “There’s a spacecraft blocking out the sky,” Yorke observes on “Decks Dark,” as choral voices pass overhead. The scene is straight from 1997’s “Subterranean Homesick Alien,” but here Yorke doesn’t sound “uptight.” He sounds utterly drained, as if impending invasion doesn’t concern him at all.</p>\n\n<p>A song title like “Glass Eyes” hints at many of the band’s longstanding morbid preoccupations—the semblance of humanity in something cold and dead, or the violation of the biological body by foreign objects—but the song is a bloodflow of strings straight into the heart. “Hey it’s me, I just got off the train,” Yorke sings, and it’s a strikingly ordinary image: the Paranoid Android himself, picking up the phone and calling someone to tell them he’s just arrived. “I feel this love turn cold,” he confesses as the ballad draws to a close, the phrasing an echo, subconscious or not, of his Kid A sign-off “I’ll see you in the next life.” A throbbing cello appears like a lump in the throat; the song fades away.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the album, Yorke’s everyday enlightenment is backed by music of expanse and abandon. The guitars sound like pianos, the pianos sound like guitars, and the mixes breathe with pastoral calm. “The Numbers,” a song about the impending apocalypse brought on by climate change, meanders along, its groove as wide as an ocean. Even the malevolent synth wave that passes through “Ful Stop” sounds like a visitor, a momentary darkness rather than a caged spirit. As the song builds, the band works up a coursing groove that will feel familiar to longtime fans, with its interlocking guitars and an arterial bustle of rhythms serving to launch Yorke’s wordless moan. It’s a sound that Radiohead has spent the last decade honing, but the payoff here is deeper and more gratifying than it has been in a while.</p>\n\n<p>The added dimension comes from Yorke, who pumps fresh oxygen into these songs, many of which have existed in sketch-like forms for years. On the lonely folk hymn “Desert Island Disk,” he sings of an epiphanic experience: “The wind rushing ‘round my open heart/An open ravine/In my spirit white.” As a vision of transformation, it feels like the inverse to Amnesiac’s “Pyramid Song,” where his only companions were the dead; here, he is “totally alive.”</p>\n\n<p>And then there’s “True Love Waits.” It’s an old song, one that has been around in various forms for over two decades, but unlike “Burn the Witch” or the other teased sketches and scraps that Radiohead diehards pick apart on forums, it’s long been a part of their canon. It appeared on the 2001 live album I Might Be Wrong and, dragged into 2016, feels like a relic from a different geological era. “I’ll drown my beliefs,” Yorke sings, “just don’t leave.” It is the message they leave us with, this very open-hearted song that has always felt like an open wound in their discography, a geyser of feeling erupting out of scorched earth. Its very inclusion is a striking moment of transparency.</p>\n\n<p>The version here is just Yorke and a piano, so reverberant and echo-drenched that it feels like we’ve stuck our heads inside it. Yorke croons tenderly, never opening up into his chest voice. It’s sung to one person this time, not crowds. In its mundane visions of “lollipops and crisps,” the lyrics purposefully skirt doggerel, an acknowledgment that cliches can be, in fact, where all the action is. “I’m not living/I’m just killing time,” the 47-year-old admits. You can write a line like that and set it to music; you can perform it for years in front of adoring millions; you can carry the idea around in your heart and mind. But it might take a lifetime for it to strike, as it does here, with a newfound power. The truth, as always, lies in plain sight, right there in the kicking and the squealing, the panic and the vomit. Some truths just take longer to see than others.</p>', 'img/reviews/reviews_3.jpg', 'img/reviews/thumb/reviews_thumb_3.jpg', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', 0),

In contrast, the artifacts of F O R M A T are often completely indistinguishable from any old VHS cassettes or MiniDiscs we’ve got collecting dust in the attic.</p>\n\n<p>Therein lies the problem. Rather than framing each physical piece as a vessel of artistic importance, with its initial limited release he displays them in a light of cumbersome inconvenience. The VHS tape features a vintage piece of Jackson’s video art, so there are exceptions to the rule here, but framing this collection of songs under the umbrella of an album (or an attempt to deconstruct one) arguably does more harm to the project than good. What ties these tunes together, aside from the fact that many of us will need to take a few trips to charity shops or grandma’s attic in order to play the entire thing?</p>\n\n<p>Jackson has denied that he intended to create an air of exclusivity with this project, and his refusal to provide tracklists for his mixes over the years was a similar exercise in encouraging fans to hunt for tunes in the same way he and others had to when looking for that absolute killer in the bins. The album’s later standard release echoes that refusal of exclusivity, but overall the project still ends up sending mixed messages.</p>\n\n<p>The music is not without fault, either. For Jackson’s most personal release to date, tying together his assorted histories as a creator and curator, his link to hip-hop is strangely and conspicuously absent. Early on in his career Jackson recorded under the alias The Underdog, crafting experimental beat collages and gritty tracks rooted in b-boy culture. This ties him to the renaissance of that very aesthetic in contemporary rap, and he misses an opportunity here by not bringing that period of his career full-circle.</p>\n\n<p>That gripe aside, there are plenty of riches to be found in F O R M A T’s 90-minute-plus running time. As frustrating as the presentation of the album might be, the music remains strong, and refutes Jackson’s initial hesitance in releasing it. He remains an undersung and uncompromising figure in the shadows of much of the music that FACT listeners love, and as contradictory and fetishistic as his vision can be at times, it remains effective.', 'img/reviews/reviews_8.jpg', 'img/reviews/thumb/reviews_thumb_8.jpg', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', 0),

Gary Gray (also responsible for Friday, among many others), recounts a loose version of their origin story, from Dr. Dre and Ice Cube’s garage collaborations to the nightclubs where they first started, and how, with Eazy’s drug money and the popularity of his first single ‘Boyz N The Hood,’ he was able to co-found his label Ruthless Records with manager Jerry Heller, who had previously worked with artists like Styx, Black Sabbath and Crosby, Stills and Nash. For rap historians and West Coast hip-hop aficionados, the lore of N.W.A. is well-known, from the rise to prominence of their controversial, FBI-defamed ‘Fuck tha Police’ to the founding of Death Row Records with Suge Knight to Dr. Dre’s liberation movement with his own Aftermath label.</p>\n\n<p>Even with that much information packed air-tight into two and a half hours, Compton is not perfect.

In a year that is robust with music biopics (Love & Mercy) and documentaries (Amy, Montage of Heck), Compton, as well as the Nina Simone doc What Happened, Miss Simone?, both have a strong focus on America’s systemic racism and police brutality epidemic. N.W.A. being forcefully interrogated by the LAPD outside of their suburban recording studio was not, and still is not, an anomaly. Despite being used as a storytelling device to the lead to the creation of ‘Fuck Tha Police’, this is a persistent reality in America. And it’s not just acted scenes of police violence. The film also includes real-life footage of the Rodney King beating and L.A. riots of 1993. Like Miss Simone’s catalogue of the March on Selma, this is a portrait of America that is still reflective of the 2010s, despite taking place decades earlier. These scenes are critical to N.W.A.’s history, but their refusal to use art as escapism, instead turning it into political critique, is only a part of their self-preservation.</p>\n\n<p>Ice Cube, who produced the film and is played by his own son O’Shea Jackson Jr., arguably had the tightest grasp of this concept. His lyrics, even as a high schooler coming up in the rap-averse nightclubs where Dre DJed, were escapist spun-yarns about women and cars and about the racial profiling he experienced throughout his life. The creation of ‘Fuck Tha Police’ is portrayed in a condensed fashion — the lyrics crafted almost immediately after the group is abused by cops outside of the swanky suburban studio where their debut album was being recorded — but it’s the still-relevant content that acts as a capsule of his experience of being young and black.

If Meek’s supposed initial issue with Drake was that he submitted a ghostwritten verse for Meek’s ‘R.I.C.O.’, watching Ice Cube pen verses for groups Dre was trying to manufacture before passing them along to Eazy-E could, perhaps, nullify Meek’s argument. However, the beef that resulted from Cube’s split from N.W.A. will also shine a light on how these entanglements required a lot more fury than mere “no woman has ever had me starstruck” barbs. The making of Cube’s N.W.A. diss ‘No Vaseline’ is one of the film’s most exhilarating moments. It’s not just the pacing from when Cube hears the group call him Benedict Arnold to them hearing ‘Vaseline’ for the first time — when Jackson, Jr. spits, “Goddamn, I’m glad ya’ll set it off,” it’s a reminder that these things are much more artistically serious than a slideshow of Twitter-mined memes.

Particularly impressive is New Orleans actor Jason Mitchell, who took on the daunting task of playing Eazy-E, but fully personified his slick, but ultimately, tragic reality.</p>\n\n<p>E himself was on the other side of the self-preservation coin. If Cube’s consistent eye-on-the-prize was the peak, from abandoning being underpaid by Ruthless to finding other avenues to create, then Eazy-E was certain he would live forever, unscathed. Mitchell portrays E as an audacious businessman consumed by money, women and fame. While these are the real stories of two interconnected men’s lives, they respectively manifest what happens if you do or do not take care of yourself.</p>\n\n<p>(This is not to leave out Dr. Dre, who is the most successful surviving member of N.W.A. and whose perseverance and triumphs are reported to us almost daily. The film portrays his alliance with Suge Knight to form Death Row Records and Dre’s business wit to get out of that messy, to put it lightly, deal when he needed more control.

	(18, 'Trevor Jackson’s first album in 15 years is ambitious and frustrating', '<h3>We’ve reached a peak dichotomy between the mentalities of acceptance in how music is applied and digested in everyday consumption.</h3>\n\n<p>On one end of the spectrum, there’s contemporary digital culture, where the majority of listeners stream and download both new and vintage music via wireless devices and cloud applications. On the other end, there’s the overt fetishization of physical formats, often of a somewhat archaic nature. Cassette tapes, compact discs, and particularly vinyl records are produced with established retail holidays and gimmicky selling points to entice buyers into thinking they are getting something rare and special, but the market for such items is now saturated. It’s hardly surprising that there’s been an backlash in recent years for overstuffed events like Record Store Day.</p>\n\n<p>Producer, graphic artist, label owner, and record collector Trevor Jackson’s newest project is an ambitious attempt to present his first album in nearly 15 years (after numerous releases as the Underdog and Playgroup) in a way that addresses the concerns of context’s importance in tangible physical media.</p>\n\n<p>F O R M A T’s initial release found each of the album’s individual tracks released as a single on a different format: 12″, 10″ and 7″ records, cassette, DAT, VHS, 8-track, and reel-to-reel tapes, 5- and 3-inch CDs, MiniDisc, and USB drives were produced in extremely limited quantities varying from 500 to just 10 each. Each format hosts an exclusive piece of new music made by Jackson over the course of his recording history on analogue hardware; a standard triple-vinyl, CD, and digital release has since been released.</p>\n\n<p>According to Jackson, the DNA strands of these tracks go back as far as old tapes he recorded in the 1990s, but have been tweaked and updated to fit thematically as an album. Listening to these cuts together, there’s a strong sonic identity woven into each piece, and Jackson’s experience as a seasoned curator and tastemaker comes through. You hear traces of the industrial/EBM club music he highlighted for Strut Records on his Metal Dance compilations (‘Lethal’, ‘OCP’), traces of Sheffield’s bleep techno (‘An Exorcism’ and the unfortunately titled ‘Voodoo Racist’), post-Eno Frippertronic ambience (‘In Your Hands’), and a hefty dose of the “knackered house” that’s become en vogue recently (‘It Hurts’, and ‘Nowhere’, which sounds like an able attempt to fuse together Andy Stott’s early sound with his current one).</p>\n\n<p>format-5.21.2015</p>\n\n<p>Jackson has spoken admiringly of producers from the L.I.E.S. and Sex Tags crews in recent interviews, and their aesthetics are present throughout, enabling much of F O R M A T to slot in nicely between material by Madteo, DJ Sotofett and Ron Morelli. Jackson’s beloved Cabaret Voltaire also prove to be a significant influence, both in their early transition from post-punk attic tape heads into the dancefloor terrorists of The Crackdown and ‘Yashar’ and in their video work. The latter appears to be an influence on the film pieces included on the VHS portion of F O R M A T, recently displayed at the album’s multimedia exhibit and showing a clear nod to Cabaret Voltaire’s Johnny Yesno.</p>\n\n<p>As much as Jackson attempts to stress that the music is just as important as the album’s release format, it’s hard to separate the two. The irony of having to attempt a connection to the music via a digital review stream is not lost on me, but even regarding the stark, no-frills design of these objects, I felt somewhat cheated. Jackson has long been a highly talented and innovative graphic artist and designer, and the intentional lack of intoxicating packaging here plays more to the beliefs that the project attempts to rebuff, rather than actually supporting the beauty of each piece of media.</p>\n\n<p>Each artifact is presented in clear PVC sleeves or boxes with stark, clinical white type: a far cry from the vibrant objects of the pre-Internet era. Even Peter Saville’s stark, challenging sleeve designs – obvious aesthetic influences for a number of Jackson’s projects over the years – left an air of mystery and intrigue. In contrast, the artifacts of F O R M A T are often completely indistinguishable from any old VHS cassettes or MiniDiscs we’ve got collecting dust in the attic.</p>\n\n<p>Therein lies the problem.

The world will open up to you. Existence will be made plain. You will be one with the matrix. Yadda yadda yadda. From arenas to memes, Drake has always had a skill for turning his innermost thoughts, feelings, and anxieties into breakthrough group therapy sessions—he articulates what we know to be true and then lets us rap or sing those truths en masse, exalting in common bonds that are as vulnerable as they are revealing. When he confides his fears, we become a little more fearless. When he turns his woes into anthems, we all get lifted. But there is a razor-sharp line between self-awareness and self-absorption: Whereas self-awareness can expand wisdom by reflecting it outward, self-absorption often festers, drawing things in only to let them rot. For the past seven years, Drake has expertly glided along that line. But on his fourth proper album, he edges closer than ever to a mirrored abyss, a suffocating echo chamber of self.</p>\n\n<p>The record is called VIEWS but its perspective is decidedly singular. “This album, I’m very proud to say, is just—I feel like I told everybody how I’m actually feeling,” Drake told Zane Lowe in a toothless recent interview, differentiating VIEWS from his previous work. This might seem like a ridiculous distinction—there’s never any question that Drake is the star of his own show—but it’s apt, and it hints at why this album feels like more of a claustrophobic mindfuck than a collective catharsis. VIEWS is what happens when venting turns into whining. Spanning an obnoxious 82 minutes, the record goes through several musical and thematic phases, but the overall atmosphere is bitter, petty, worn-down. It confuses loyalty and stagnation, wallowing in a sound that is starting to show its limits.</p>\n\n<p>Until the last minute, the album was to be called Views from the 6, and it still serves as an ode to Drake’s hometown of Toronto. After having other producers handle the lion’s share of beats on his last two mixtapes, Drake\'s longtime musical consigliere, Noah “40” Shebib, returns to the head of the table here, with production credits on 12 of the album’s 20 tracks. The atmosphere 40 creates with his music is now synonymous with Drake’s Toronto; the harsh chill of winter is brought forth via cold snares and ice-cube synths, with the summer’s relief often rendered through sped-up ‘90s R&B samples that quietly churn in the background. It’s essentially a screwed-down take on Kanye West’s chipmunk soul, and it has provided a perfect backdrop for Drake’s poignant introspection while ushering in an entire stage of hip-hop’s evolution.</p>\n\n<p>But on VIEWS, the style is simply getting tired, its wintry mood now actively blocking any springtime salvation. It’s also bringing out some of Drake’s most self-loathing tendencies, playing into his groaning paranoia on tracks like “9,” where he laments, “Life is always on, man, I never get a break from it/Doesn’t matter where I go, I can never get away from it.” Songs like these play out like dour self-fulfilling prophecies, puffed-up bad attitudes drunk on their own misery. They also expose the downside of a “no new friends” mindset and how a bunker mentality can snub out curiosity. Marked by frigidness and a furrowed brow, much of VIEWS may be true to Toronto’s darker months, but it also makes the city sound like a pretty inhospitable place.</p>\n\n<p>Fact is, the 6 is one of the most multicultural places on Earth, a sprawling metropolis in which more than 140 different languages and dialects are spoken. And it’s when VIEWS embraces this more inviting and open-minded side of Toronto that it points to a better way forward. Drake’s fascination with the city’s Caribbean enclaves take root in the effervescent rhythms of songs like “With You,” “One Dance,” and “Too Good”—all of them featuring welcomed guest vocals that break up the monotony and also allow Drake to get out of his own brain for a second.</p>\n\n<p>Rihanna co-stars on “Too Good,” finally offering a counterpoint to Drake’s constant disappointment with the opposite sex; when she sings “You take my love for granted, I just don’t understand it,” she’s giving voice to all of the women Drake has spurned on record over the years. (Perhaps tellingly, she only gets to sing the line alongside her duet partner.) Because while Drake’s relationship dissections were once questioning and openly hurt, they too have hardened—at this point, it’s getting impossible to believe he’s not the one to blame for so many squandered attempts at love.</p>\n\n<p>Even slight tweaks to Drake’s usual sound pay dividends here. “Childs Play” finds 40 putting his spin on New Orleans bounce, bringing out Drake’s more playful side as he raps about a lady friend who gets in a fight with him at The Cheesecake Factory and takes his Bugatti for a spin to pick up some tampons. The song’s angst plays out more like a jokey spat than another existential treatise on the hopelessness of searching for the girl of his dreams. “Feel No Ways” is another sad story, but its beat—which zips up Malcolm McClaren’s 1983 hip-hop experiment “World’s Famous”—harkens back to Drake’s masterpiece, Take Care, adding levity and the sense that these feelings, like all feelings, will not be so heavy in time. “Weston Road Flows” is another throwback, with Drake reminiscing about his salad days over a gorgeous Mary J. Blige sample, another instance of a woman’s voice helping to add humanity to the rapper’s toughened exterior. The song finds Drake looking back on his come-up with fondness and, naturally, some melancholy. But when he lets out a little cackle at the end of the track, it’s not out of spite. He sounds like he’s genuinely enjoying himself on the song. It’s nice to hear.</p>\n\n<p>If last year’s If You’re Reading This It’s Too Late had Drake doing his best all-guns-blazing Tony Montana, shedding his softness for an untouchable-don pose, VIEWS has him on his Tony Soprano, trying to reach deep into his own psyche for revelations but often just falling back on a sour version of what got him this far. Perhaps its shortcomings are in part due to a cloistered view of what being candid really means. “I’m an honest person, I can’t write fiction,” Drake said last week. “It all directly has to do with me or else I can’t make the music.” While artistic honesty is certainly something to aspire to, it doesn’t have to equate with blinding selfishness or even concrete reality. Drake’s most apparent current rap peers, Kanye and Kendrick Lamar, have both let their minds wander to surreal places in order to add depth and intrigue to their own music, and nobody would accuse them of dishonesty. Such inventiveness is required for the type of longevity Drake seems to crave. Because knowing thyself is a quest. It never ends.</p>', 'img/reviews/reviews_5.jpg', 'img/reviews/thumb/reviews_thumb_5.jpg', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', 0),
	(22, 'Radiohead - \'A Moon Shaped Pool\' Review', '<p>Radiohead, who titled their ninth studio album A Moon Shaped Pool, have a unique grasp on how easily profundity can slip into banality. Their music is obsessed with the point where great truths harden into platitudes, where pure signal meets wretched noise. In the past, Thom Yorke has sharply peppered his lyrics with everyday cliches to suggest a mind consumed by meaningless data, but on the new album, he largely moves beyond cynicism. He is now considering simpler truths in a heretofore-unexplored register: wonder and amazement. “This goes beyond me, beyond you,” he sings on “Daydreaming.” “We are just happy to serve you.” There is no concealed razor under Yorke’s tongue as he offers this thought, or in the pearly music that surrounds him. It sounds for all the world like the most cloistered and isolated soul in modern rock music opening up and admitting a helplessness far more personal than he’s ever dared. Yorke has flirted with surrender before, and on A Moon Shaped Pool, that submission feels nearly complete.</p>\n\n<p>The album is framed by two older pieces of music that act as gateways to the darker, unfamiliar waters within. Opener “Burn the Witch” has been floating around, in some form or another, since Kid A. “This is a low-flying panic attack,” Yorke announces, explicitly linking to the bad old days of air crashes, iron lungs, and wolves at doors. (In fact, several of the song’s lyrics—“avoid all eye contact,” “cheer at the gallows”—first appeared in the album art to 2003’s anti-Bush polemic Hail to the Thief.) Meanwhile, Jonny Greenwood’s brittle modernist string arrangement reinforces the angst, turning the orchestra into a giant pair of gnashing teeth. It’s a vintage splash of Radiohead stomach acid, a cloud of gnats unleashed in your cranial nerves.</p>\n\n<p>It also feels like an exorcism for what follows: a plunge into something scarier than the military industrial complex, or the insidious nature of propaganda, or human nature’s disturbing tendency towards unquestioning obedience. Yorke separated from his partner of 23 years and the mother to his two children last August, and on “Identikit,” he sings “Broken hearts make it rain” and “When I see you messin’ me around, I don’t want to know.”</p>\n\n<p>That isn’t to say that this is necessarily a “break-up album.” Separations (particularly those involving children) take place in the harsh light of day, with lawyers’ appointments and checklists and logistical arrangements. Radiohead albums are the stuff of dreams and nightmares, and the band retains a healthy resistance to clarity; their music is a maze of signs you can peer into any way you like. Even so, the impact of trauma, a sort of car crash of the soul, is palpable. The music here feels loose and unknotted, broken open in the way you can only be after a tragedy. “There’s a spacecraft blocking out the sky,” Yorke observes on “Decks Dark,” as choral voices pass overhead. The scene is straight from 1997’s “Subterranean Homesick Alien,” but here Yorke doesn’t sound “uptight.” He sounds utterly drained, as if impending invasion doesn’t concern him at all.</p>\n\n<p>A song title like “Glass Eyes” hints at many of the band’s longstanding morbid preoccupations—the semblance of humanity in something cold and dead, or the violation of the biological body by foreign objects—but the song is a bloodflow of strings straight into the heart. “Hey it’s me, I just got off the train,” Yorke sings, and it’s a strikingly ordinary image: the Paranoid Android himself, picking up the phone and calling someone to tell them he’s just arrived. “I feel this love turn cold,” he confesses as the ballad draws to a close, the phrasing an echo, subconscious or not, of his Kid A sign-off “I’ll see you in the next life.” A throbbing cello appears like a lump in the throat; the song fades away.</p>\n\n<p>Throughout the album, Yorke’s everyday enlightenment is backed by music of expanse and abandon. The guitars sound like pianos, the pianos sound like guitars, and the mixes breathe with pastoral calm. “The Numbers,” a song about the impending apocalypse brought on by climate change, meanders along, its groove as wide as an ocean. Even the malevolent synth wave that passes through “Ful Stop” sounds like a visitor, a momentary darkness rather than a caged spirit. As the song builds, the band works up a coursing groove that will feel familiar to longtime fans, with its interlocking guitars and an arterial bustle of rhythms serving to launch Yorke’s wordless moan. It’s a sound that Radiohead has spent the last decade honing, but the payoff here is deeper and more gratifying than it has been in a while.</p>\n\n<p>The added dimension comes from Yorke, who pumps fresh oxygen into these songs, many of which have existed in sketch-like forms for years. On the lonely folk hymn “Desert Island Disk,” he sings of an epiphanic experience: “The wind rushing ‘round my open heart/An open ravine/In my spirit white.” As a vision of transformation, it feels like the inverse to Amnesiac’s “Pyramid Song,” where his only companions were the dead; here, he is “totally alive.”</p>\n\n<p>And then there’s “True Love Waits.” It’s an old song, one that has been around in various forms for over two decades, but unlike “Burn the Witch” or the other teased sketches and scraps that Radiohead diehards pick apart on forums, it’s long been a part of their canon. It appeared on the 2001 live album I Might Be Wrong and, dragged into 2016, feels like a relic from a different geological era. “I’ll drown my beliefs,” Yorke sings, “just don’t leave.” It is the message they leave us with, this very open-hearted song that has always felt like an open wound in their discography, a geyser of feeling erupting out of scorched earth. Its very inclusion is a striking moment of transparency.</p>\n\n<p>The version here is just Yorke and a piano, so reverberant and echo-drenched that it feels like we’ve stuck our heads inside it. Yorke croons tenderly, never opening up into his chest voice. It’s sung to one person this time, not crowds. In its mundane visions of “lollipops and crisps,” the lyrics purposefully skirt doggerel, an acknowledgment that cliches can be, in fact, where all the action is. “I’m not living/I’m just killing time,” the 47-year-old admits. You can write a line like that and set it to music; you can perform it for years in front of adoring millions; you can carry the idea around in your heart and mind. But it might take a lifetime for it to strike, as it does here, with a newfound power. The truth, as always, lies in plain sight, right there in the kicking and the squealing, the panic and the vomit. Some truths just take longer to see than others.</p>', 'img/reviews/reviews_3.jpg', 'img/reviews/thumb/reviews_thumb_3.jpg', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', 0),
	(23, 'Chance The Rapper - \'Coloring Book\' Review', '<p>On the cusp of becoming a household name, Chance The Rapper has glided towards stardom almost exclusively from an online buzz that’s just begun gaining real world traction. Going against the grain naturally, his nearly mystic rise hasn’t relied on typical career boosting crutches: Chance’s songs have generally been devoid of Auto-Tune and absent from radio rotation or nightclubs, he’s never inspired a trendy dance craze, yet he’s amassed a loyal following determined to see these differences bear fruit. Arguably the face of Chicago Hip Hop’s present momentum, his impact has given voice to a conflicted generation whose psyche is at war; adolescents and young adults influenced by Kanye West’s ingenious innovation with a bleak firsthand view of the low life expectancy Chief Keef popularized.</p>\n\n<p>Since starting to rap professionally while fresh out of puberty, Chance The Rapper has become an open book unafraid to deal with his growing pains publicly. A most humble and charitable figure for the Windy City, if comparisons to Kendrick Lamar aren’t inevitable, they’re readily abundant. Two sides of the same coin using their voices in tandem with live instrumentation, the rageful angst from Compton’s "good kid" is the yin to the yang of Chance’s lighter and more subdued panic. Another commonality arises as they’ve both pushed the envelope creatively to explain the pressures of their gang-ridden environments without begging for acceptance from greater society. On a more rebellious note, the pair have managed to fit in while wedging personal responsibility in a youth driven culture that leans towards shirking progression.</p>\n\n<p>Making thematic cover art for each release, 10 Day represented Chance The Rapper’s cautious and hopeful beginnings, Acid Rap could be interpreted as fear in the face of the storm, and Coloring Book is a clever smile of contentment. Foreshadowed by The Life Of Pablo’s “Ultralight Beam,” the bulk of the project celebrates his faith and how far it’s quickly brought him up the rap game’s ladder. Early previews came by way of “Blessings” premiering on Jimmy Fallon’s stage recently and “Angels” being done on Stephen Colbert’s show last year. The two unabashedly Christian songs respectively explain his grassroots approach of giving away music, as he says “I don’t make songs for free, I make ‘em for freedom” and “I’m still at my old church, only ever sold merch.” Album opener "All We Got" is a triumphant praise session where Chance modestly flexes his good fortune including being a new father. With the aid of frequent bandmate Donnie Trumpet, he employs a Sunday morning preacher’s style of building up to an explosive outburst, as Kanye and the Chicago Children’s Choir bring things full circle from the protégé’s greatest exposure to date just three months ago.</p>\n\n<p>Acid Rap was Chance The Rapper’s instantaneous breakthrough with features including Ab-Soul, Childish Gambino and Action Bronson, rising peers who were in sync with his left-field niche. Coloring Book attempts reinventing the wheel not only with a heavier emphasis on God, but our protagonist taking noticeable risks walking amongst Hip Hop’s supposed sinners much like Jesus did. Upon a first listen, “No Problem” is off-putting given Chance’s awkward flow most reminiscent of Young Thug’s widely debated spontaneity (not to mention a flashy appearance by 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne’s standard codeine-addled lack of substance). The song grows to be catchy upon multiple spins, but this effect isn’t replicated as linguistic acrobat Young Thugger himself and quirky newcomer Lil Yachty contribute little worth to “Mixtape,” one of Coloring Book’s dullest moments. A surprising highlight comes by way of trap rhythm meeting heavenly melodies on the smooth yet rousing “Smoke Break”, where Future’s performance sounds almost palatable as opposed to his well renowned erratic means of turning up. This curveball is indicative of Chance’s capacity to shape the culture at his will, whether he plays these reindeer games to bridge gaps for the genre or simply capitalize on his growing fame.</p>\n\n<p>Refusing to be boxed into preconceived notions, Chance The Rapper is not only adjusting the paradigm for independent business, his presence has the potential to save the minds and lives of endangered Chicagoans. A sequel of sorts to last year’s less memorable compilation Surf (namely its single "Sunday Candy"), Coloring Book further reflects his liberty to create as he pleases. “Finish Line/Drown” admits to a prior harmful Xanax addiction as Chance sprints towards salvation. After this confessional the two-parter transitions from Hip Hop completely into gospel, as devout holy roller Kirk Franklin takes the baton from him to pray on wax together for a second time in 2016.</p>\n\n<p>As a mix of the secular and spiritual worlds, Coloring Book is sure to perplex Chance The Rapper’s fickle fans and satisfy the more adventurous open to being thrown for a loop. Rather than cheap ploys to cross over, the questionable collaborations are more likely calculated concessions with the intent of sneaking his evangelical message to a greater audience. After the communion cup runs empty, Chance proves himself worthy of hero worship by subtly and subversively overthrowing the commercialized horrors of his town’s violent drill movement.</p>', 'img/reviews/reviews_1.jpg', 'img/reviews/thumb/reviews_thumb_1.jpg', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-05-01 00:00:00', '2016-05-01 00:00:00', 0),
	(24, 'N.W.A. biopic Straight Outta Compton is a true summer blockbuster', '<p>Straight Outta Compton, a forthcoming biopic about the formative L.A. rap group N.W.A., is layered with the message of self-preservation — and is becoming increasingly more timely within pop culture the closer it gets to its US release date on August 14.</p>\n\n<p>Comprised of Ice Cube, Dr. Dre, Eazy-E, MC Ren and DJ Yella, the “reality rap” technicians — the term was theirs; it was often called “gangster rap” by the media, which, historically, stuck — built a new tentpole in the genre, highlighting the truths of their own lives through narratives about guns, drugs and unwarranted police brutality.</p>\n\n<p>The film, helmed by legendary music video director F. Gary Gray (also responsible for Friday, among many others), recounts a loose version of their origin story, from Dr. Dre and Ice Cube’s garage collaborations to the nightclubs where they first started, and how, with Eazy’s drug money and the popularity of his first single ‘Boyz N The Hood,’ he was able to co-found his label Ruthless Records with manager Jerry Heller, who had previously worked with artists like Styx, Black Sabbath and Crosby, Stills and Nash. For rap historians and West Coast hip-hop aficionados, the lore of N.W.A. is well-known, from the rise to prominence of their controversial, FBI-defamed ‘Fuck tha Police’ to the founding of Death Row Records with Suge Knight to Dr. Dre’s liberation movement with his own Aftermath label.</p>\n\n<p>Even with that much information packed air-tight into two and a half hours, Compton is not perfect. Much of the narrative is tweaked for entertainment purposes and brutal stories like Dr. Dre’s misogyny-fueled assault of music journalist Dee Barnes have been omitted from script. One could argue that the preservation of N.W.A.’s legacy and creating a portal for younger rap fans to see into some of this crucial history of the genre is important — and this wouldn’t be wrong, but an awareness that this is a friendlier, so to speak, version of their story is important, too.</p>\n\n<p>But aside from just crystallizing N.W.A.’s place in music history, there are story arcs within Compton that mirror life today, despite taking place well over two decades ago. Early into the film, Cube is confronted by the police for simply walking out of Dr. Dre’s house. In a year that is robust with music biopics (Love & Mercy) and documentaries (Amy, Montage of Heck), Compton, as well as the Nina Simone doc What Happened, Miss Simone?, both have a strong focus on America’s systemic racism and police brutality epidemic. N.W.A. being forcefully interrogated by the LAPD outside of their suburban recording studio was not, and still is not, an anomaly. Despite being used as a storytelling device to the lead to the creation of ‘Fuck Tha Police’, this is a persistent reality in America. And it’s not just acted scenes of police violence. The film also includes real-life footage of the Rodney King beating and L.A. riots of 1993. Like Miss Simone’s catalogue of the March on Selma, this is a portrait of America that is still reflective of the 2010s, despite taking place decades earlier. These scenes are critical to N.W.A.’s history, but their refusal to use art as escapism, instead turning it into political critique, is only a part of their self-preservation.</p>\n\n<p>Ice Cube, who produced the film and is played by his own son O’Shea Jackson Jr., arguably had the tightest grasp of this concept. His lyrics, even as a high schooler coming up in the rap-averse nightclubs where Dre DJed, were escapist spun-yarns about women and cars and about the racial profiling he experienced throughout his life. The creation of ‘Fuck Tha Police’ is portrayed in a condensed fashion — the lyrics crafted almost immediately after the group is abused by cops outside of the swanky suburban studio where their debut album was being recorded — but it’s the still-relevant content that acts as a capsule of his experience of being young and black. Cube was unafraid to shirk money from Ruthless and leave the group in favor of fair representation, even if he was taking on the lion’s share of the lyrical work.</p>\n\n<p>08Suge2-articleLarge</p>\n\n<p>‘NO VASELINE’ IS A REMINDER THAT THESE THINGS ARE MUCH MORE ARTISTICALLY SERIOUS THAN A SLIDESHOW OF TWITTER-MINED MEMES.”</p>\n<p>The film will land while we’re still in the midst, or at least in the dwindling down, of Drake and Meek Mill’s rap beef. If Meek’s supposed initial issue with Drake was that he submitted a ghostwritten verse for Meek’s ‘R.I.C.O.’, watching Ice Cube pen verses for groups Dre was trying to manufacture before passing them along to Eazy-E could, perhaps, nullify Meek’s argument. However, the beef that resulted from Cube’s split from N.W.A. will also shine a light on how these entanglements required a lot more fury than mere “no woman has ever had me starstruck” barbs. The making of Cube’s N.W.A. diss ‘No Vaseline’ is one of the film’s most exhilarating moments. It’s not just the pacing from when Cube hears the group call him Benedict Arnold to them hearing ‘Vaseline’ for the first time — when Jackson, Jr. spits, “Goddamn, I’m glad ya’ll set it off,” it’s a reminder that these things are much more artistically serious than a slideshow of Twitter-mined memes. And Jackson Jr.’s performance in this scene perfectly embodies his father’s spark.</p>\n\n<p>The acting is another one of Compton’s bright spots. Music biopics always have some kind of awkward element to them. Notorious was crammed with misfired casting and some mediocre portrayals of the players, save Naturi Naughton’s brilliant Lil’ Kim. It is slightly jarring to watch Paul Giamatti play Jerry Heller amongst a group of unknown kids, but their performances stack up to his Oscar-nominated caliber of acting. Particularly impressive is New Orleans actor Jason Mitchell, who took on the daunting task of playing Eazy-E, but fully personified his slick, but ultimately, tragic reality.</p>\n\n<p>E himself was on the other side of the self-preservation coin. If Cube’s consistent eye-on-the-prize was the peak, from abandoning being underpaid by Ruthless to finding other avenues to create, then Eazy-E was certain he would live forever, unscathed. Mitchell portrays E as an audacious businessman consumed by money, women and fame. While these are the real stories of two interconnected men’s lives, they respectively manifest what happens if you do or do not take care of yourself.</p>\n\n<p>(This is not to leave out Dr. Dre, who is the most successful surviving member of N.W.A. and whose perseverance and triumphs are reported to us almost daily. The film portrays his alliance with Suge Knight to form Death Row Records and Dre’s business wit to get out of that messy, to put it lightly, deal when he needed more control. He was and is similarly-minded to Ice Cube, but is shown as much more low-key. And, yes, there are appearances from Snoop Dogg and 2Pac.)</p>\n\n<p>With all of its aforementioned faults, as well as some way too on-the-nose dialogue and chronologically misplaced music, Straight Outta Compton is a true summer blockbuster. It is knee-slappingly funny, tugs at your heartstrings and the acting is meticulous. Despite its length, it moves quickly and keeps the viewer consistently engaged, but it’s not to be viewed for pure historical accuracy. (And, no doubt, there will be people who believe the entire thing to be constructed by Hollywood; these are the same people who were shocked when Ian Curtis hanged himself at the end of Control.) But it’s clear that the screenwriters, Ice Cube and Gray were intent to preserve N.W.A.’s legacy in the most favorable way possible. It’s another benchmark in Cube’s career-long history of self-preservation.</p>', 'img/reviews/reviews_7.jpg', 'img/reviews/thumb/reviews_thumb_7.jpg', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', 0),

Most of them, though, point back to Skepta. Tottenham’s Joseph Adengua had a crack at the charts like all the rest, donning a white suit and skanking about with girls in bikinis on the video to 2008’s ‘Rolex Sweep’. But it was Skepta, more than anyone, who saw the potential in a return to grime’s first principles. His 2014 single ‘That’s Not Me’, made with his brother Jme, and promoted with an £80 video, set out the formula: hard rhymes, street fashion, alpha male attitude. He wasn’t the only MC out there grafting – but by example, he proved what was still possible.</p>\n\n<p>‘Konnichiwa’ has been promised pretty much since ‘That’s Not Me’ hit the charts, the sort of timespan that usually sets expectations unreasonably high. Incredibly, it meets them on all counts. Skepta is on scorching form throughout, his direct, firmly enunciated bars addressing rival MCs (‘Lyrics’, featuring grime upstart Novelist), life in the fast lane (‘Detox’, featuring Boy Better Know compadres Frisco, Shorty and Jammer) and hassle from the feds – see ‘Crime Riddim’, a menacing UK trap anthem on which Skepta faces the prospect of a strip-search with typical forthrightness: “Fuck that, I ain’t a Chippendale”. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are familiar themes – but brilliantly, ‘Konnichiwa’ is packed with surprises. It’s quintessentially British, a grime album to the core – but big and confident enough to feature a guest production and vocal from Pharrell Williams (see the bouncy ‘Numbers’, a witty two fingers to music industry sharks), or casually sample Queens Of The Stone Age on the broiling ‘Man (Gang)’. </p>\n\n<p>Best of all, it’s practically filler-free. Most grime albums get unstuck when they get sentimental, or approach the boudoir. But ‘Ladies Hit Squad’, featuring a purring D Double E and A$AP Nast, proves grime can get jiggy, while ‘Text Me Back’ is a love letter, Skepta pleading with his girl to stay patient while he’s out there doing his thing. She’d better get herself a good hobby: ‘Konnichiwa’ is a landmark in British street music, a record good enough to take on the world without having to compromise one inch in the process.</p>\n', 'img/reviews/reviews_4.jpg', 'img/reviews/thumb/reviews_thumb_4.jpg', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', 0),

One could argue that the preservation of N.W.A.’s legacy and creating a portal for younger rap fans to see into some of this crucial history of the genre is important — and this wouldn’t be wrong, but an awareness that this is a friendlier, so to speak, version of their story is important, too.</p>\n\n<p>But aside from just crystallizing N.W.A.’s place in music history, there are story arcs within Compton that mirror life today, despite taking place well over two decades ago. Early into the film, Cube is confronted by the police for simply walking out of Dr. Dre’s house. In a year that is robust with music biopics (Love & Mercy) and documentaries (Amy, Montage of Heck), Compton, as well as the Nina Simone doc What Happened, Miss Simone?, both have a strong focus on America’s systemic racism and police brutality epidemic. N.W.A. being forcefully interrogated by the LAPD outside of their suburban recording studio was not, and still is not, an anomaly. Despite being used as a storytelling device to the lead to the creation of ‘Fuck Tha Police’, this is a persistent reality in America. And it’s not just acted scenes of police violence. The film also includes real-life footage of the Rodney King beating and L.A. riots of 1993. Like Miss Simone’s catalogue of the March on Selma, this is a portrait of America that is still reflective of the 2010s, despite taking place decades earlier. These scenes are critical to N.W.A.’s history, but their refusal to use art as escapism, instead turning it into political critique, is only a part of their self-preservation.</p>\n\n<p>Ice Cube, who produced the film and is played by his own son O’Shea Jackson Jr., arguably had the tightest grasp of this concept. His lyrics, even as a high schooler coming up in the rap-averse nightclubs where Dre DJed, were escapist spun-yarns about women and cars and about the racial profiling he experienced throughout his life. The creation of ‘Fuck Tha Police’ is portrayed in a condensed fashion — the lyrics crafted almost immediately after the group is abused by cops outside of the swanky suburban studio where their debut album was being recorded — but it’s the still-relevant content that acts as a capsule of his experience of being young and black. Cube was unafraid to shirk money from Ruthless and leave the group in favor of fair representation, even if he was taking on the lion’s share of the lyrical work.</p>\n\n<p>08Suge2-articleLarge</p>\n\n<p>‘NO VASELINE’ IS A REMINDER THAT THESE THINGS ARE MUCH MORE ARTISTICALLY SERIOUS THAN A SLIDESHOW OF TWITTER-MINED MEMES.”</p>\n<p>The film will land while we’re still in the midst, or at least in the dwindling down, of Drake and Meek Mill’s rap beef. If Meek’s supposed initial issue with Drake was that he submitted a ghostwritten verse for Meek’s ‘R.I.C.O.’, watching Ice Cube pen verses for groups Dre was trying to manufacture before passing them along to Eazy-E could, perhaps, nullify Meek’s argument. However, the beef that resulted from Cube’s split from N.W.A. will also shine a light on how these entanglements required a lot more fury than mere “no woman has ever had me starstruck” barbs. The making of Cube’s N.W.A. diss ‘No Vaseline’ is one of the film’s most exhilarating moments. It’s not just the pacing from when Cube hears the group call him Benedict Arnold to them hearing ‘Vaseline’ for the first time — when Jackson, Jr. spits, “Goddamn, I’m glad ya’ll set it off,” it’s a reminder that these things are much more artistically serious than a slideshow of Twitter-mined memes. And Jackson Jr.’s performance in this scene perfectly embodies his father’s spark.</p>\n\n<p>The acting is another one of Compton’s bright spots. Music biopics always have some kind of awkward element to them. Notorious was crammed with misfired casting and some mediocre portrayals of the players, save Naturi Naughton’s brilliant Lil’ Kim. It is slightly jarring to watch Paul Giamatti play Jerry Heller amongst a group of unknown kids, but their performances stack up to his Oscar-nominated caliber of acting. Particularly impressive is New Orleans actor Jason Mitchell, who took on the daunting task of playing Eazy-E, but fully personified his slick, but ultimately, tragic reality.</p>\n\n<p>E himself was on the other side of the self-preservation coin. If Cube’s consistent eye-on-the-prize was the peak, from abandoning being underpaid by Ruthless to finding other avenues to create, then Eazy-E was certain he would live forever, unscathed. Mitchell portrays E as an audacious businessman consumed by money, women and fame. While these are the real stories of two interconnected men’s lives, they respectively manifest what happens if you do or do not take care of yourself.</p>\n\n<p>(This is not to leave out Dr. Dre, who is the most successful surviving member of N.W.A. and whose perseverance and triumphs are reported to us almost daily. The film portrays his alliance with Suge Knight to form Death Row Records and Dre’s business wit to get out of that messy, to put it lightly, deal when he needed more control. He was and is similarly-minded to Ice Cube, but is shown as much more low-key. And, yes, there are appearances from Snoop Dogg and 2Pac.)</p>\n\n<p>With all of its aforementioned faults, as well as some way too on-the-nose dialogue and chronologically misplaced music, Straight Outta Compton is a true summer blockbuster. It is knee-slappingly funny, tugs at your heartstrings and the acting is meticulous. Despite its length, it moves quickly and keeps the viewer consistently engaged, but it’s not to be viewed for pure historical accuracy. (And, no doubt, there will be people who believe the entire thing to be constructed by Hollywood; these are the same people who were shocked when Ian Curtis hanged himself at the end of Control.) But it’s clear that the screenwriters, Ice Cube and Gray were intent to preserve N.W.A.’s legacy in the most favorable way possible. It’s another benchmark in Cube’s career-long history of self-preservation.</p>', 'img/reviews/reviews_7.jpg', 'img/reviews/thumb/reviews_thumb_7.jpg', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', 0),
	(28, 'Jarvis Cocker - \'EP\' Review', '<p>When Jarvis Cocker recorded a tribute to the victims of the Paris terrorist attacks and broadcast it on his Radio 6 Music show – Jarvis Cocker’s Sunday Service – last November, listeners dared to dream he might record new music again. Aside from some deeply experimental cuts for his 20 Golden Greats exhibition, the Pulp frontman hasn’t brought out any new music since his 2009 solo album ‘Further Complications’, suggesting he’d all but retired from recording. Well, fear not, because Jarvis has returned and he’s back to his lascivious, brazen best on this four-track EP, written to accompany the upcoming TV series Likely Stories.</p>\n\n<p>Based on four short stories by author Neil Gaiman and directed by Iain Forsyth and Jane Pollard (who oversaw the Nick Cave mockumentary 20,000 Days On Earth), the series consists of, in Cocker’s own words, “four grubby tales set in all-night cafés, low-rent drinking dens and doctor’s surgeries”.</p>\n\n<p>Cocker’s passion for Paris (where he used to live) is evident, with ‘Main Theme’ undoubtedly influenced by his hero, scandalous French singer Serge Gainsbourg. We’ve been here before of course, on all of Pulp’s 1998 album ‘This Is Hardcore’ and bits of 1995’s ‘Different Class’, but never quite to this degree of salacity. The roll call of musicians includes Portishead’s Adrian Utley on synths and Scott Walker’s percussionist Alasdair Malloy, but it’s Jarvis’s inimitable spoken word that really gets the hairs on the back of your neck standing to attention.</p>\n\n<p>“Roundheads and cavaliers,” he quivers, “adult themes and childhood fears”. Our avuncular protagonist goes on to list a baby in a jar, an old man in a car and a cow jumping over the moon – and if things weren’t surreal enough, he’s then joined by a celestial choir. It’s a cinematic and slightly troubling creation perfect for a series of small-screen psychological thrillers, but ‘Main Theme’ stands up on its own as a composition too. The remaining tracks are scaled-down variations on the same musical theme, including the creepy ‘Looking For The Girl’, and ‘Foraging’, where he recites a list of edible fungi found in Britain.</p>\n\n<p>It’s been a while, but if this taster is anything to go by, you can hopefully prepare yourselves for some more vintage Jarvis in the not-too-distant future.</p>', 'img/reviews/reviews_2.jpg', 'img/reviews/thumb/reviews_thumb_2.jpg', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', '2016-04-01 00:00:00', 0);
